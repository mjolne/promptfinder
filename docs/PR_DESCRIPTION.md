# CSS Optimization for Performance

## Summary

This PR completes the CSS optimization phase following the recent CSS restructuring. The optimization focuses on enhancing performance by minifying CSS, adding vendor prefixes for better cross-browser compatibility, and providing tools for ongoing CSS management and optimization.

## Changes

### 1. CSS Minification System

- Created `minify-css.sh` script that automatically generates production-ready minified CSS
- Generated minified versions of all CSS files in the `css-min` directory
- Achieved ~8-9% file size reduction across all CSS files

### 2. CSS Quality Improvements

- Added `improve-css-quality.sh` to enhance CSS with vendor prefixes and standardized formatting
- Improved browser compatibility through prefixed properties
- Created `css-clean` directory for quality-improved CSS files

### 3. Environment Switching System

- Added `switch-css-env.sh` to toggle between development and production CSS
- Simplified testing workflow with easy switching between original and minified CSS

### 4. CSS Analysis Tools

- Created `find-unused-css.sh` to identify potentially unused CSS classes
- Developed `css-usage-analysis.js` for deeper CSS usage insights
- Added tools for ongoing CSS optimization

### 5. Build Process Integration

- Updated package.json with new npm scripts for CSS optimization:
  - `npm run css:minify` - Creates minified CSS
  - `npm run css:improve` - Improves CSS quality
  - `npm run css:analyze` - Analyzes CSS usage
  - `npm run css:switch` - Switches between dev/prod CSS
  - `npm run build:prod` - Full production build with CSS optimization

### 6. Documentation

- Added `CSS_OPTIMIZATION.md` with detailed optimization process
- Created `CSS_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` for quick reference
- Updated related documentation to reflect new optimization capabilities

## Testing

- Tested the minified CSS by switching between development and production modes
- Verified that all UI components render correctly with optimized CSS
- Confirmed that browser compatibility is maintained or improved

## Benefits

1. **Performance Improvement**: ~8-9% reduction in CSS file sizes leads to faster load times
2. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Better organized and documented CSS makes future updates easier
3. **Workflow Improvements**: Simple commands for switching between development and production modes
4. **Future-Proof**: Created tools for ongoing CSS optimization and analysis

## Screenshots

Before optimization:

- Total CSS size: ~32 KB

After optimization:

- Total CSS size: ~29 KB (minified)

## Notes for Reviewers

- The optimization is non-breaking - all functionality remains the same
- The PR includes both the tools and their output (minified CSS)
- Review the `switch-css-env.sh` script if you want to test both versions
