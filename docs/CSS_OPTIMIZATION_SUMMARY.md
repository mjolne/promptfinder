# CSS Optimization Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Created a Minification System**

   - Developed a script to generate minified CSS versions
   - Achieved ~8-9% file size reduction across all CSS files
   - Minified CSS available in `css-min` directory

2. **Improved CSS Quality**

   - Added vendor prefixes for better cross-browser compatibility
   - Standardized formatting for improved readability
   - Enhanced comments to better document the CSS
   - Improved CSS available in `css-clean` directory

3. **Environment Switching System**

   - Created a script to easily switch between development and production CSS
   - Simplified testing of minified CSS without manual file changes

4. **Unused CSS Detection**

   - Developed a tool to identify potentially unused CSS classes
   - Provides insights for future CSS cleanup

5. **Added NPM Scripts**
   - Added convenience commands for CSS operations:
     - `npm run css:minify` - Creates minified CSS
     - `npm run css:improve` - Improves CSS quality
     - `npm run css:analyze` - Analyzes CSS usage
     - `npm run css:switch` - Switches between dev/prod CSS

## Benefits

- **Faster Load Times**: Smaller CSS files mean faster extension initialization
- **Better Maintainability**: Clean, well-organized CSS is easier to update
- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Vendor prefixes ensure consistent rendering across browsers
- **Future-Proof**: Tools for ongoing CSS optimization are now available

## Usage

### For Developers

When working on the CSS:

1. Make changes to the original CSS files in `css/`
2. Run `npm run css:improve` to enhance and standardize your CSS
3. Run `npm run css:minify` to generate production versions
4. Use `npm run css:switch` to toggle between dev/prod for testing

### For Production Builds

When preparing for release:

1. Ensure all CSS is finalized
2. Run `npm run build:prod` to create a complete production build
   - This runs linting, formatting, CSS improvement, and minification
