Optimize CSS for performance and maintainability

This commit implements comprehensive CSS optimization following the
recent CSS restructuring project. The optimization focuses on:

1. CSS Minification: Created a system to generate minified production CSS,
   achieving 8-9% file size reduction

2. CSS Quality: Added tools to improve CSS quality with vendor prefixes
   and standardized formatting

3. Environment Switching: Implemented system to toggle between development
   and production CSS

4. Build Integration: Updated package.json with new scripts for CSS
   operations: css:minify, css:improve, css:analyze, and css:switch

5. Documentation: Added CSS_OPTIMIZATION.md and CSS_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md
   to document the optimization process and workflow

The optimization is non-breaking and maintains full compatibility with
existing functionality while improving performance and maintainability.

This completes the CSS optimization phase of the modularization roadmap.
