**Document Version:** 1.1  
**Created:** June 7, 2025  
**Updated:** June 7, 2025  
**Owner:** Product Team  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

## 1. Introduction/Overview

Implement comprehensive user behavior analytics using Google Analytics 4 (GA4) via the Measurement Protocol to understand user engagement patterns, identify optimization opportunities, and drive data-informed product decisions for the PromptFinder Chrome extension. The implementation will use direct HTTP requests to GA4 servers following Chrome Extension best practices for Manifest V3 compliance.

**Problem Statement:** Currently, PromptFinder lacks comprehensive user behavior tracking, limiting our ability to understand feature usage patterns, identify user pain points, optimize user onboarding, and make data-driven product decisions.

## 2. Goals

1. **Primary Goal:** Implement comprehensive analytics tracking for user engagement, conversion funnels, and technical performance
2. **Chrome Extension Compliance:** Use GA4 Measurement Protocol following Chrome Extension best practices and Manifest V3 requirements
3. **Data Quality:** Follow Google Analytics best practices using recommended event names and parameters
4. **Service Worker Integration:** Track analytics events from service workers and all extension contexts
5. **Debugging Capability:** Enable GA4 debugger functionality for testing and validation
6. **Stakeholder Insights:** Provide actionable data for product team, developers, and business stakeholders

## 3. User Stories

**As a Product Manager**, I want to understand which features users engage with most, so that I can prioritize development efforts on high-impact functionality.

**As a Developer**, I want to track technical performance and error rates, so that I can identify and resolve issues that impact user experience.

**As a Business Stakeholder**, I want to see conversion funnels from signup to active usage, so that I can understand user adoption patterns and optimize our growth strategy.

**As a Privacy-Conscious User**, I want to understand what analytics data is collected and have the option to disable tracking, so that I can use the extension while maintaining my privacy preferences.

**As a QA Engineer**, I want to validate analytics implementation through GA4 debugger, so that I can ensure accurate data collection before production deployment.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Core Analytics Infrastructure

1. **The system must** implement GA4 Measurement Protocol using direct HTTP requests to Google Analytics servers
2. **The system must** generate and store unique client_id using crypto.randomUUID() in chrome.storage.local
3. **The system must** implement session management using chrome.storage.session with configurable timeout
4. **The system must** provide internal analytics enable/disable mechanism for development purposes
5. **The system must** gracefully handle analytics unavailability without impacting core extension functionality
6. **The system must** work across all extension contexts (popup, content scripts, service worker)

### 4.2 Event Tracking Requirements

7. **The system must** track user engagement events using GA4 recommended event names:

   - `page_view` events for popup, settings, and extension page navigation
   - `login` and `sign_up` events for authentication
   - `search` events for prompt discovery
   - `select_content` events for prompt interactions
   - Custom events for prompt-specific actions (copy, favorite, rate)

8. **The system must** track conversion funnel events:

   - User registration to first login
   - First session to first prompt interaction
   - Prompt viewing to prompt copying/favoriting
   - Account creation to first prompt creation

9. **The system must** track technical performance metrics:
   - Extension startup and page load times
   - Service worker error tracking using `extension_error` events
   - Cloud function performance and error rates
   - Unhandled promise rejections and exceptions

### 4.3 Data Collection Standards

10. **The system must** never collect personally identifiable information (PII)
11. **The system must** use crypto.randomUUID() generated client_id for user identification
12. **The system must** track prompt metadata (length, category, tags count) but never actual prompt content
13. **The system must** implement session-based tracking with 30-minute timeout and custom session management
14. **The system must** include required parameters: session_id and engagement_time_msec for realtime reporting
15. **The system must** include custom parameters for user properties (account age, user type, favorite categories)

### 4.4 Testing and Validation

16. **The system must** use GA4 debug endpoint (https://www.google-analytics.com/debug/mp/collect) for testing
17. **The system must** be testable through GA4 Realtime Report for event validation
18. **The system must** include development/staging event filtering to separate test data from production
19. **The system must** provide console logging for event tracking in development mode
20. **The system must** include automated tests for analytics service methods and event validation

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **User-facing analytics data:** No analytics data will be displayed to end users
- **Real-time user notifications:** No alerts or notifications based on analytics data
- **Cross-platform tracking:** Focus only on Chrome extension, excluding potential web app integration
- **Advanced ML/AI insights:** Basic analytics only, no predictive modeling in initial implementation
- **Revenue tracking:** No e-commerce or monetization event tracking
- **Social sharing analytics:** No tracking of external sharing or social media integration
- **Consent Management Platform:** No CMP integration due to Chrome Extension limitations
- **Geolocation tracking:** Not available when using Measurement Protocol

## 6. Design Considerations

### 6.1 Measurement Protocol Implementation

- Use direct fetch requests to GA4 endpoint: `https://www.google-analytics.com/mp/collect`
- Implement client_id generation and persistence using chrome.storage.local
- Handle session management with chrome.storage.session and configurable timeout
- Ensure all events include session_id and engagement_time_msec parameters

### 6.2 Service Worker Integration

- Implement analytics tracking from service worker context for error monitoring
- Handle unhandled promise rejections and extension errors
- Ensure service worker analytics persist across extension lifecycle
- Track service worker performance and initialization metrics

### 6.3 Privacy-First Implementation

- **Storage Permissions:** Require "storage" permission for client_id and session management

### 7.2 GA4 Measurement Protocol Integration

- **API Credentials:** Obtain measurement_id (G-...) and api_secret from GA4 account
- **Endpoint:** Use https://www.google-analytics.com/mp/collect for production
- **Debug Endpoint:** Use https://www.google-analytics.com/debug/mp/collect for testing
- **Event Limits:** Stay within GA4 event parameter limits (25 custom parameters per event)
- **Data Retention:** Configure 14-month data retention following GA4 defaults

### 7.3 Session and Client Management

- **Client ID:** Generate using self.crypto.randomUUID() and store in chrome.storage.local
- **Session Management:** Use chrome.storage.session with 30-minute timeout
- **Session ID:** Use timestamp-based session identification
- **Cross-Context Sharing:** Ensure client_id and session_id work across popup, content scripts, service worker
