# PRD: Chrome Web Store Launch Readiness

## Introduction/Overview

Prepare the PromptFinder extension for submission and approval on the Chrome Web Store. This involves ensuring full compliance with Chrome Web Store policies, comprehensive testing across all categories, performance optimization, and file cleanup to create a production-ready extension package.

## Goals

1. **Compliance**: Achieve 100% compliance with Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies
2. **Quality Assurance**: Complete comprehensive testing across functional, performance, security, and accessibility domains
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize load time and memory usage to industry standards
4. **Production Readiness**: Clean up unnecessary files and optimize the extension package
5. **Analytics Validation**: Confirm GA4 tracking works in both production and debug modes
6. **Submission Preparation**: Create a complete submission package with all required assets and documentation

## User Stories

1. **As a Chrome Web Store reviewer**, I want to see an extension that fully complies with all policies so that I can approve it without concerns.

2. **As an end user**, I want the extension to load quickly and use minimal memory so that it doesn't impact my browser performance.

3. **As a developer**, I want comprehensive test coverage and automated validation so that I can be confident the extension works reliably across different scenarios.

4. **As a product owner**, I want clear analytics data from both production and debug modes so that I can monitor extension usage and performance.

## Functional Requirements

### Chrome Web Store Policy Compliance

1. **Privacy Policy Compliance**: Verify data collection practices align with declared permissions and privacy policy
2. **Permission Justification**: Ensure all requested permissions are necessary and properly documented
3. **Content Guidelines**: Validate all user-facing content meets Chrome Web Store guidelines
4. **Manifest Validation**: Confirm manifest.json follows latest Manifest V3 specifications
5. **Metadata Accuracy**: Verify extension name, description, and screenshots accurately represent functionality

### Testing Requirements

6. **Functional Testing**: Test all core features (prompt management, search, filtering, user authentication)
7. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Validate functionality across different Chrome versions and operating systems
8. **Security Testing**: Audit for XSS vulnerabilities, secure data handling, and proper authentication flows
9. **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all UI components
10. **Performance Testing**: Measure and optimize load times and memory usage
11. **Error Handling**: Test edge cases, network failures, and invalid inputs

### Performance Optimization

12. **Load Time Optimization**: Achieve extension popup load time < 200ms
13. **Memory Usage Optimization**: Ensure memory usage stays < 50MB during normal operation
14. **Bundle Size Optimization**: Minimize extension package size while maintaining functionality
15. **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for non-critical components

### File and Package Optimization

16. **Dependency Audit**: Remove unused dependencies and dev-only files from production build
17. **Asset Optimization**: Compress images, minify CSS/JS, and optimize icon files
18. **Build Process Validation**: Ensure production build excludes test files, source maps, and development tools
19. **File Structure Cleanup**: Remove unnecessary configuration files and temporary files

### Analytics Validation

20. **GA4 Production Mode**: Verify analytics tracking works correctly in production environment
21. **GA4 Debug Mode**: Confirm debug analytics provide detailed event tracking for development
22. **Event Tracking**: Validate all user interactions are properly tracked
23. **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure analytics implementation respects user privacy preferences

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **New Features**: No new functionality will be added during this launch preparation phase
2. **UI/UX Changes**: No visual design modifications unless required for compliance
3. **Third-party Integrations**: No new external service integrations
4. **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization is not included in this scope
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Complex analytics dashboards or custom metrics are out of scope

## Design Considerations

- Maintain current UI/UX design with focus only on compliance-required changes
- Ensure all existing accessibility features remain intact
- Preserve current responsive design and mobile compatibility
- Keep existing branding and visual identity consistent

## Technical Considerations

- **Build System**: Utilize existing Rollup configuration for production builds
- **Testing Framework**: Leverage current Jest setup for automated testing
- **Firebase Integration**: Ensure all Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Analytics) work in production
- **CSP Compliance**: Verify Content Security Policy settings meet Chrome Web Store requirements
- **Manifest V3**: Confirm full compliance with Manifest V3 specifications
- **Browser Compatibility**: Target latest 2 Chrome versions as specified in browserslist
