### 🔥 CRITICAL BUG FIXES (May 2025) - COMPLETED

**Status**: ✅

**Issue**: Prompt lists were empty across all tabs (All, Favorites, Private) due to DOM element reference mismatch preventing Clusterize.js virtualization from working.

**Root Cause**: The `cacheDOMElements` function in `js/ui.js` was referencing a non-existent DOM element ID (`prompts-list`) instead of the actual HTML structure (`prompts-list-scroll`).

**Fixes Applied**:

1. ✅ **DOM Element Reference Fix**: Updated `js/ui.js` line 772 to reference correct element ID
2. ✅ **Clusterize.js Library Integration**: Replaced placeholder content with actual Clusterize.js v0.18.1 library
3. ✅ **Build Configuration Fix**: Added `js/clusterize.min.js` to ESLint ignore list to prevent linting errors
4. ✅ **Verification**: Confirmed fixes are included in distribution bundle (`dist/js/app.js`)

**Impact**:

- ✅ Prompt lists now display correctly in all tabs
- ✅ Clusterize.js virtualization working for performance with large datasets
- ✅ Build process stable and error-free
- ✅ Extension fully functional for prompt management

- ✅ After adding a new prompt, users are redirected to the details view for that prompt (improved workflow).
- ✅ Chrome extension warning for message passing ("Could not establish connection") is now silenced unless a real error occurs.
  - ⬜ Further refine the display of prompt ownership.
  - ✅ Expanded UI unit tests to cover the new private prompt lock icon and other rendering edge cases.
  - ⬜ Add further UI unit tests for edge cases: missing/undefined `isPrivate`, title escaping, long/truncated titles, accessibility of lock icon, and regression for legacy prompt objects.
  - ⬜ Expand tests for tab switching, search/filter, and error handling in UI.
  - ⬜ Continue refining prompt ownership display and optimize performance for large prompt datasets.
- ⬜ Review and improve overall popup layout, detached window forms, and user flows based on testing and feedback.
- ⬜ Consider UI for managing `targetAiTools` if it needs to be more than a text input.

4. ⬜ **Performance Testing & Optimization**: Basic checks for data loading, query performance, and UI responsiveness, especially after bundling and with larger datasets.

**Next Recommended Step:**

**Performance Optimization & Ownership Display:**

- Focus on optimizing UI performance for large prompt datasets (virtualized lists, lazy loading, or query optimization).
- Continue refining the display and management of prompt ownership (e.g., clearer indicators for owned prompts, owner actions, and permissions).
- After performance and ownership improvements, consider expanding integration/end-to-end tests and accessibility audits.

**Open Questions/Notes**:

- How to handle truly anonymous users if they are allowed to view public prompts before sign-in? (Current assumption: sign-in is required for most read/write actions other than viewing public prompts).
- Detailed strategy for migrating prompts from a previous system (if applicable) is deferred.
- Cloud Functions setup considerations:
  - Function region (europe-west1) was chosen to better align with Firestore region (europe-north2)
  - Client-side code now properly delegates data aggregation to server-side functions
  - Development workflow uses Firebase emulators for local testing
  - For optimal cost management, consider implementing function usage monitoring and throttling if needed
