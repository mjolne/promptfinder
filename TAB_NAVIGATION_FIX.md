# Tab Navigation Fix

## Issue

After the CSS optimization, the tab navigation in the extension was displaying incorrectly. The tabs needed to be restored to their original pill-shaped design, with the active tab highlighted in purple.

## Fix Applied

Updated the tab navigation styling in the tabs.css component file to match the original design:

1. Modified the existing tabs.css file to support pill-shaped styling for the simplified HTML structure
2. Changed the active tab state to use background color instead of just underlines
3. Applied proper spacing and border-radius to create the pill effect
4. Removed redundant styling from popup.css and consolidated all tab styling in the tabs.css component

## Files Modified

- `/css/components/tabs.css` - Extended to support the simplified tab structure in popup.html
- `/css/pages/popup.css` - Removed redundant tab styling
- `/css-min/components/tabs.css` - Updated minified version with new tab styling
- `/css-min/pages/popup.css` - Updated minified version with redundant styles removed
- `/popup.html` - Removed unnecessary link to tab-fix.css

## Changes Made

- Removed the separate tab-fix.css files (both regular and minified versions)
- Changed the tab navigation to use pill-shaped buttons in a horizontal row
- Updated active tab styling to use a purple background with white text
- Applied rounded corners (border-radius) to create the pill effect
- Fixed a CSS property typo in the minified popup.css: `ext-align` â†’ `text-align`

## Test Results

All tests are now passing, and the navigation tabs should now display correctly as pill-shaped tabs with proper active state highlighting, matching the original design.
