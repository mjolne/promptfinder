# CSS Optimization for Performance

This PR implements comprehensive CSS optimization to improve the performance and maintainability of the PromptFinder extension following the recent CSS restructuring.

## Changes Overview

### üöÄ Performance Improvements

- Created a CSS minification system that reduces file sizes by ~8-9%
- Generated minified versions of all CSS files in the `css-min` directory
- Enhanced CSS with vendor prefixes for better cross-browser compatibility

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Tools

- Added `switch-css-env.sh` to easily toggle between development and production CSS
- Created `find-unused-css.sh` to identify potentially unused CSS
- Implemented `improve-css-quality.sh` to standardize formatting and add prefixes

### üì¶ Build Process Integration

- Added new npm scripts in `package.json`:

  ```json
  "css:minify": "bash ./minify-css.sh",
  "css:improve": "bash ./improve-css-quality.sh",
  "css:analyze": "bash ./find-unused-css.sh",
  "css:switch": "bash ./switch-css-env.sh",
  "build:prod": "npm run lint && npm run format && npm run css:improve && npm run css:minify"
  ```

### üìö Documentation

- Created `CSS_OPTIMIZATION.md` with detailed documentation of the optimization process
- Added `CSS_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` for quick reference

## Testing

All optimization has been tested to ensure:

- The minified CSS renders identical to the development CSS
- The environment switcher correctly updates all HTML files
- The build process successfully integrates CSS optimization

## Before & After

**Before optimization:**

- Total CSS size: ~32 KB

**After optimization:**

- Total CSS size: ~29 KB (minified)

## Screenshots

## Next Steps

After this PR is merged:

1. Developers can use the new npm scripts for CSS operations
2. The production build will include minified CSS
3. Future CSS development can take advantage of the quality improvement tools

## Related Issues

This PR completes the CSS optimization phase mentioned in the MODULARIZATION_ROADMAP.md document.
